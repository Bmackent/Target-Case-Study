# Target Case Study - myRetail Restful Service
I chose the first case study option as it looked like a good way to demonstrate what I learned at amazon. In addition, amazon had their own
build system. I used maven to build this project as a way to showcase my ability to quickly pick up new technologies and put them to use.

# Technologies Used
JDK 1.8.0

DynamoDB

Apache Maven 3.6.2

SpringBoot 2.1.6.RELEASE

# DynamoDB Setup 
I used the local version of DynamoDB for this project. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html for details about usage. The basic setup steps are as follows:
1. Download the local version of DynamoDB
2. Extract the downloaded files to a directory of your choice
3. Open the chosen directory in command prompt
4. Run java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb
5. You may need to run aws configure to set up access key region settings.
6. I added initialization code in ProductPricingDatabase.java that will populate the database with some pricing data for a few products. 
You will not need to add data yourself.

# Unit Tests
1. Open the myRetail directory in command prompt
2. Run mvn test

# Running the Application 
1. Ensure that your local version of DynamoDB is running
2. Open the myRetail directory in command prompt
3. Run mvn spring-boot:run

# Using the Requested APIs
As mentioned earlier, pricing data has been populated in the DynamoDB table. There is pricing data for the following products:
1. 13860428
2. 13860429
3. 13860431

### Responds to an HTTP GET request at /products/{id} and delivers product data as JSON
1. In a browser of your choice, go to http://localhost:8080/products/{id}
2. See that JSON data is returned for the requested product

### BONUS: Accepts an HTTP PUT request at the same path (/products/{id}), containing a JSON request body similar to the GET response, and updates the productâ€™s price in the data store
1. In a browser of your choice, go to http://localhost:8080/products/{id}
2. See that JSON data is returned and note the current pricing information

3. Using a method of your choice (I used an application called Postman), send a PUT request to http://localhost:8080/products/{id}. I copied my Postman request below:

        PUT /products/13860428 HTTP/1.1
        Host: localhost:8080
        Content-Type: application/json
        cache-control: no-cache
        Postman-Token: 716b6baa-8580-4dc0-8171-a67ccf0727ba
        {
            "id": 13860428,
            "name": "The Big Lebowski (Blu-ray)",
            "productPricingInfo":{
                "id":13860428,
                "price":15.99,
                "currencyCode":"USD"
            }
        }
4. Refresh the page in your browser and see that the data has been updated as per the PUT request
